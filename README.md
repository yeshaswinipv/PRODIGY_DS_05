Dataset - Traffic Accident


Traffic Accident Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The analysis includes visualizations of accident hotspots and contributing factors.


Overview

Understanding the factors contributing to traffic accidents is crucial for improving road safety and implementing preventive measures. This project aims to explore a dataset of traffic accidents and extract actionable insights to enhance road safety initiatives.


Features

        •	Data Loading: Load traffic accident data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

        •	Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of accidents across different states, weather conditions, road conditions, and timing of the day.

        •	Data Visualization: Visualize accident hotspots, distribution based on weather and road conditions, timing of accidents, and contributing factors through various plots and charts.

        •	Pattern Recognition: Explore patterns related to road and weather conditions, as well as timing of accidents.

        •	Total Death Timing Ratio: Analyze the total death timing ratio for each state based on different timing categories.
